# LoLFKeys

They F1 - F5 keys in League of Legends are used to jump your camera to each player on your team. They are ordered by the pick order to F1 will always correspond to the first pick. I found this to be a problem since I wanted to F1 to always correspond to top laner, F2 to jungler and so on.

This small script allowed me to fix that by setting what lane is what pick order, but since then Riot Games have implemented a feature that allows you to rearrange champions so this tool is no longer useful.
